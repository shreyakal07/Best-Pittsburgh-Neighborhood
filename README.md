## Datasets
### [City Facilities](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-facilities/resource/fbb50b02-2879-47cd-abea-ae697ec05170)
This dataset provided by WPRDC displayed the number of city facilities each neighborhood had access to. To use this data set in our scoring metric, we assumed that the more city facilities
a neighborhood had, the better it was. 
### [Playgrounds](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds/resource/47350364-44a8-4d15-b6e0-5f79ddff9367)
This dataset provided by WPRDC displayed the number of playgrounds in each neighborhood. To scale this as a comparable metric, we adjusted each neighborhoods score based on the amount of playgrounds in the neighborhood, and scaled them relative to each other.
### [Crime Rate](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/police-incident-blotter/resource/1797ead8-8262-41cc-9099-cbc8a161924b)
This dataset provided information on the number of crimes in each neighborhood. When deciding metrics, we considered the highest safety rate, i.e. lowest crime rate, to be the best neighborhood. 

## Summary
### What is the best Pittsburgh neighborhood? 
Through our findings, we scored each Pittsburgh neighborhood based off the data collected in each data set. By adminisitering each neighborhood with its percentage score scaled off of the highest acheiver in each data set (most facilites, most playgrounds, highest safety rate),
we found that **New Homestead** had the highest cumulative score thus recieving the title of *best Pittsburgh neighborhood*.
